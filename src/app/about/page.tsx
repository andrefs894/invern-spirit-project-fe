                <p>
                  I  have a background in scenography and props & costume design, a  course in high school I took at the first and only circus school in  Lisbon, called Chapit√¥.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I  have been developing skills with AutoCAD, Sketchup and VRay in academic  and personal projects, to pursue my interests in the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My  main interests are to imagine and create living and functional spaces  that inspire the day-to-day life of people who live or work in them. 
                </p>
